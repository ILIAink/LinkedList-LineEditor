## Purpose

- Introducing a user-friendly text editor that empowers users to effortlessly load and modify their desired text files using pre-defined commands. Users can perform a range of operations such as appending, inserting, and deleting lines, replacing words, getting word counts, printing the entire text, saving the text, and more.

## Why it's cool

- This project was developed using a test-driven approach. I leveraged the JUnit framework to create comprehensive test cases for each function within the LineList class. This meticulous process not only simplifies debugging but also guarantees that each function runs properly.
- In this project, I opted to use the Linked List data structure to navigate the loaded text file. This choice offers a more efficient way to insert and delete lines when compared to the commonly used array approach.
